A take () function that receives one number at a time and returns the middle number from all the numbers it has received so far.
The function holds all numbers in a particular data structure. 
The function did not know how many times it would be called, and it should allocate memory exactly the size it should hold and no more. 
The function works efficiently with O (1).
